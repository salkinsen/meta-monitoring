Important: For these scripts to work, this repository (meta-monitoring) needs be cloned into the same folder that the [adapted microservice demo](https://github.com/salkinsen/microservices-demo) project is cloned into. It should look something like this:

```
.
├──  microservice-demo
├──  meta-monitoring
```

Some of the scripts need jq. It can been installed e.g. via snap:
```bash
sudo snap install jq
```
